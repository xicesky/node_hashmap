# node_hashmap
Hashing, HashMap, LinkedHashMap for node js

I consider this hacky, alpha code. It doesn't have tests, either. Don't use it :)

## TODO
 - Make this a proper node installable library
 - Add proper tests
 - Documentation
 - Seperate modules for Hash, HashMap, LinkedHashMap
 - Use ES6 features correctly (const, iterators...)
 - Fix "hashNumber" (they should distribute much more)
 - Use a better method than linear scan
 - Fix "hashMap" (define the order of keys, it's undefined in ES6)
